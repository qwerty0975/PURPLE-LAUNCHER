PURPLE LAUNCHER UPDATE SYSTEM
=============================

Patch System Overview:
----------------------
Purple Launcher uses a PATCH-based versioning system. Each PATCH is a full, standalone build of the launcher. There are no incremental updates or patch files — every release is complete and self-contained.

Patch Naming Format:
--------------------
PATCH X       = Major update (new features, UI changes, systems)  
PATCH X.Y     = Bugfix update (fixes, minor improvements)  
PATCH X.Y.Z   = Backend-only update (refactors, optimizations, invisible changes)

Examples:
---------
PATCH 1       - Initial release  
PATCH 2       - Adds preset manager and map support  
PATCH 2.1     - Fixes mod loading crash  
PATCH 2.1.1   - Refactors config system for better performance

How Updates Work:
-----------------
- Each PATCH is released as a full folder or installer.  
- Users download the new PATCH and replace the old version manually.  
- No previous version is required — every PATCH is self-contained.  
- Older PATCHES can be kept for rollback or archival purposes.

Patch Tracking:
---------------
- The current PATCH version is stored in a local file (e.g. version.txt).  
- The launcher displays the current PATCH version in the GUI.  
- Changelog files may be included with each release.

Update Philosophy:
------------------
- Clean, modular, and easy to maintain  
- No risk of partial updates breaking the launcher  
- Easy to expand with new features, assets, and content  
- Ideal for closed-source distribution
